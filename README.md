# contact-details-tabular-form

There are more than 4k items in JSON. You can use Angular JS ( Preferably 1 ) framework to develop this task. If you can implement using​​ ES6 standard, it would be appreciated.

#### Functional Requirements : 
- List the contacts and the details in a tabular format. The challenge would be to optimally utilize the cells/divs and data and to reuse them. The table should scroll smoothly without lags. 
- Load 50 items from JSON on initial load
- We should be able to search the contacts in a search box (by at least name. If you provide more search options, more points will be awarded). It should be able to search and filter as you type in the characters in the search box at runtime.
